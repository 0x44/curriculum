Careers in operations
*********************

Introduction
============

Taking a step into Operations can be daunting. At present there are few
professional degrees, and the ones that exist focus on specialised topics such
as systems administration, network engineering or security.

However, the Operations landscape is significantly larger than that. This page
aims to provide a detailed view on the careers you can move to as you enter the
field.

Deciding a career path
======================

Around the end of the 101 level of Ops School, you will want to start thinking
about which career path you want to take. The paths tend to overlap in places,
and both paths can lead to similar places down the road.
Imagine two roads that run straight, and occasionally get close or overlap, but
generally head in the same direction.

Your two options are usually:

* Operations generalist
* Operations specialist

The one you choose, should be the one you feel most comfortable with. Over time,
as your skills grow, both paths should lead to similar opportunities: team
leadership, senior technical leadership, and management.
The way you travel each path is considerably different, and it isn't uncommon to
switch from one path to another once or twice.


Generalised career paths

Persons in generalised careers are often in high demands by employers.
While the adage states "Jack of all trades, master of none", an operations
generalist is very much expected to be *"Master of almost all trades."*

It's quite common to see a good operations engineer who is well versed in
systems administration, database administration, network engineering, security
engineering, and other topics.

Similarly, operations managers are expected to know a wide variety of subjects
at a reasonable enough level to make good technical decisions. Often, people who
choose to become operations managers begin their careers as either generalists,
or specialists in one or more fields.

Generalist roles are often most highly prized in technical companies and
startups, where it is beneficial to be able to work with multiple technologies
and groups well.

Unlike generalists, specialists are often hired to take care of certain
components of larger systems. While generalists tend to focus on increasing both
the bredth and depth of their knowledge over time, specialists work to become
deep subject matter experts. Common areas of focus are databases, networking,
security, capacity planning, project management, training, and more.
In almost all cases these require at least the 101 level of understanding, and
fully understanding through the 201 level is better.
