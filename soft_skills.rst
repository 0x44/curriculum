The importance of Documentation
===============================

What to document
----------------

* Runbooks? SOP? (cparedes: might be worthwhile even though we want to automate
  SOP’s away as much as possible - what should we check at 2 AM? What do folks
  typically do in this situation if automation fails?)

* Architecture and design (cparedes: also maybe talk about *why* we choose that
  design - what problems did we try to solve? Why is this a good solution?) How
  to manage documentation
